This project is an AI-based Helmet Violation Detection System that automatically detects motorcycle riders not wearing helmets and extracts their vehicle number plates using computer vision techniques. It's designed to assist traffic authorities in enforcing helmet laws and enhancing road safety.

🔍 Features
🚦 Detects two-wheeler riders from live video or image feeds

❌ Identifies whether the rider is wearing a helmet

🔢 Extracts the number plate of riders without helmets

📸 Can be integrated with CCTV surveillance systems

🧠 Uses deep learning models (YOLO / CNN) for object detection

🔡 Utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for license plate reading

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV

YOLOv5 / YOLOv8 (or custom helmet detection model)

Tesseract OCR

Flask (for web interface, if any)
